### Convert flat & ugly JSON into beautiful and easy to read JSON

### How to use:

### When and why should you use the JSON Pretty Printer?
Well, if your engineers use 3rd party tools (like  [jsonformatter](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com)) for parsing sensitive or confidential customer data, they could be POSTing that data to unknown territories. Download the JSON Pretty Printer, host it internally, and make sure your private data never gets POSTed across the web again.
